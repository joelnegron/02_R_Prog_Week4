## 1 Plot the 30-day mortality rates for heart attack

Read the outcome data into R via the read.csv function and look at the rst few rows.

```{r}
outcome <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
head(outcome)
```

There are many columns in this dataset. You can see how many by typing ncol(outcome) (you can see
the number of rows with the nrow function). In addition, you can see the names of each column by typing
names(outcome) (the names are also in the PDF document.)

To make a simple histogram of the 30-day death rates from heart attack (column 11 in the outcome dataset),
run:
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
outcome[, 11] <- as.numeric(outcome[, 11])
hist(outcome[, 11])

```
Because we originally read the data in as character (by specifying colClasses = "character" we need to
coerce the column to be numeric. You may get a warning about NAs being introduced but that is okay.

## 2 Finding the best hospital in a state

Write a function called best that take two arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state and an
outcome name. The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv le and returns a character vector
with the name of the hospital that has the best (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specied outcome
in that state. The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. The outcomes can
be one of \heart attack", \heart failure", or \pneumonia". Hospitals that do not have data on a particular
outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
Handling ties. If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome, then the hospital names should
be sorted in alphabetical order and the rst hospital in that set should be chosen (i.e. if hospitals \b", \c",
and \f" are tied for best, then hospital \b" should be returned).
The function should use the following template.
best <- function(state, outcome) {
## Read outcome data
## Check that state and outcome are valid
## Return hospital name in that state with lowest 30-day death
## rate
}
The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid state value is passed to best, the
function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message \invalid state". If an invalid
outcome value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact
message \invalid outcome".
Here is some sample output from the function.
> source("best.R")
> best("TX", "heart attack")
[1] "CYPRESS FAIRBANKS MEDICAL CENTER"
> best("TX", "heart failure")
[1] "FORT DUNCAN MEDICAL CENTER"
> best("MD", "heart attack")
[1] "JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL, THE"
> best("MD", "pneumonia")
[1] "GREATER BALTIMORE MEDICAL CENTER"
> best("BB", "heart attack")
Error in best("BB", "heart attack") : invalid state
> best("NY", "hert attack")
Error in best("NY", "hert attack") : invalid outcome
>
Save your code for this function to a le named best.R.
















## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
